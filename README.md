| gre_verbal         | INTEGER             | The candidate's self-reported GRE Verbal score. If `is_new_gre` is 1, this field should be between 130 and 170 inclusive. If 0, then it should be between 200 and 800 exclusive.                             |
| gre_quant          | INTEGER             | The candidate's self-reported GRE Quantitative score. If `is_new_gre` is 1, this field should be between 130 and 170 inclusive. If 0, then it should be between 200 and 800 exclusive.                       |

| gre_subject        | INTEGER             | The candidate's self-reported GRE Subject Test score. It can range in the 900s. Presumably, given that this is a CS dataset, I'd assume the subject in question is Computer Science.                         |
| status             | TEXT(28)            | The status of the candidate. Can take on 4 different values - "American", "International", "International with US degree" and "Other".                                                                       |
